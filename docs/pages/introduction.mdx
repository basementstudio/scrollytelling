# BSMNT Scrollytelling

BSMNT Scrollytelling is a library for creating Scrollytelling animations. It's powered by GSAP ScrollTrigger, but abstracts away some things to make it work better with React.

## Why

At [basement](https://basement.studio/), we've built a bunch of websites that use scroll animations. Over the years, we faced some issues that required solutions that we copy-pased throughout different project. We decided to build a library to share how we build these with the world.

**Challenges we faced**

- Needed a deep understanding of how GSAP works with ScrollTrigger.
- Needed to be careful about running animations inside `useEffect` and then cleaning them up.
- Couldn’t think of scroll animations in terms of a `start` and an `end`, so it was hard to fire up animations at the exact scroll progress we needed to.

## What

We aimed at componentizing a way of building scroll animations that could:

- ✅ Provide sensible defaults for scroll animations, such as `scrub: true`, and `ease: 'linear'`.
- ✅ Take care of component mounting and unmounting.
- ✅ Create animations with absolute positioning defined by a `start` and an `end`, instead of a time-based `duration`.

As an added benefit, going "component-based" allowed us to:

- ✅ Improve compatibility with React Server Components: our components definitely `'use client'`, but not necessarily the parents or children of our components.
- ✅ Compose animations at every level of the tree, as it all works with React Context.

A simple example of how this works:
