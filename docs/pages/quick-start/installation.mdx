## Installation

To get started, we'll need the `@bsmnt/scrollytelling` package, as well as the required peer dependency: [GSAP](https://greensock.com/docs/).

```zsh copy
yarn add @bsmnt/scrollytelling gsap
```

## Exports

- `Root`: Creates timeline and scrollTrigger, provides React Context.
- `Animation`: Appends an animation to the timeline. Receives a `tween` prop that will control how the animation behaves.
- `Waypoint`: Runs a callback or tween at a specific point in the timeline. Can also receive a `label` prop, that will create a GSAP label at that position.
- `RegisterGsapPlugins`: Registers custom GSAP plugins, if you need them for a specific use case.
- `Parallax`: Helper to create a simple parallax.
- `ImageSequenceCanvas`: Helper to create a simple image sequence animation.
- `useScrollytelling`: Context consumer. Returns the `timeline`.
- `useScrollToLabel`: Scrolls to the label name you pass. Labels can be added with the `Waypoint` component.
