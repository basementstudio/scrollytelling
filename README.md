# BSMNT Scrollytelling

BSMNT Scrollytelling is a library for creating Scrollytelling animations. It's powered by GSAP ScrollTrigger, but abstracts away some things to make it work better with React.

## Installation

To get started, we'll need the `@bsmnt/scrollytelling` package, as well as the required peer dependency: [GSAP](https://greensock.com/docs/).

```zsh
yarn add @bsmnt/scrollytelling gsap
```

## Why

At [basement](https://basement.studio/), we've built a bunch of websites that use scroll animations. Over the years, we faced some issues that required solutions that we copy-pased throughout different project. While preparing his talk for the React Miami Conference, [JB](https://twitter.com/julianbenegas8) decided to build a library to share how we build these with the world.

**Challenges we faced**

- Needed a deep understanding of how GSAP works with ScrollTrigger.
- Needed to be careful about running animations inside `useEffect` and then cleaning them up.
- Couldn’t think of scroll animations in terms of a `start` and an `end`, so it was hard to fire up animations at the exact scroll progress we needed to.

## What

We aimed at componentizing a way of building scroll animations that could:

- ✅ Provide sensible defaults for scroll animations, such as `scrub: true`, and `ease: 'linear'`.
- ✅ Take care of component mounting and unmounting.
- ✅ Create animations with absolute positioning defined by a `start` and an `end`, instead of a time-based `duration`.

As an added benefit, going "component-based" allowed us to:

- ✅ Improve compatibility with React Server Components: our components definitely `'use client'`, but not necessarily the parents or children of our components.
- ✅ Compose animations at every level of the tree, as it all works with React Context.

A simple example of how this works:

## Exports

- `Root`: Creates timeline and scrollTrigger, provides React Context.
- `Animation`: Appends an animation to the timeline. Receives a `tween` prop that will control how the animation behaves.
- `Waypoint`: Runs a callback or tween at a specific point in the timeline. Can also receive a `label` prop, that will create a GSAP label at that position. 
- `RegisterGsapPlugins`: Registers custom GSAP plugins, if you need them for a specific use case.
- `Parallax`: Helper to create a simple parallax.
- `ImageSequenceCanvas`: Helper to create a simple image sequence animation.
- `useScrollytelling`: Context consumer. Returns the `timeline`.
- `useScrollToLabel`: Scrolls to the label name you pass. Labels can be added with the `Waypoint` component.

## Demo

For our talk at React Miami Conf, we did a small demo to showcase this library in action. This is the best place to see how the library works in a real world scenario. Check it out:
